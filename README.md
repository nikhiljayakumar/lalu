# LALU

An Arithmetic Logic Unit that can add, subtract, load, store, and move 16 bit numbers. 

Created through [Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) in the [Digital Electronics](https://lasacs.com/de/) class at LASA.

Subcircuit files must be placed in same directory as LALU, but are seperated for clarity.
Subcircuits within the 'eightBitAdderFull' circuit need to be changed from 'Logisim-Evolution' to 'Custom' Appearance.

Python file coding instructions to hex (provided by teacher)
Sample program max.txt to find the max of 16bit numbers given a start and end index.
